### Setting up EmailJS
In order to use the sendEmail utility, which is what enables users to send a message to the site owner and allows users to get quotes emailed to them, you must set up an [EmailJS](https://www.emailjs.com/s) account and set up a few internal features as follows.
1. Create Free Account
2. Add new email service & note the **Service ID** (you will need this later)
![Screenshot of EmailJS](./public//img/documentation/emailJS-setupService.png)
This will enable emailJs to use whatever email you register as a 'service' to send email on behalf of this web app. This email will be in the 'from' field once all is setup. So pick a good one. 
<!-- ![Screenshot of Email](./public//img/documentation/emailJS-from.png) -->
3. Next, set up an two templates: outbound & inbound
![Screenshot of EmailJS](./public//img/documentation/emailJS-emailTemplate.png)
  * Set up an Inbound template (like the one below) & save
    ![Screenshot of EmailJS](./public//img/documentation/emailJS-inboundTemplate.png)
      * Note that the items in double curly braces {{ like this }} are varaibles that will be populated autmatically by the web app – the inputs you're expecting for the inbound template are:
        1. {{ user_name }} will be populated by the user's name
        2. {{ user_email }} will be populated by the user's email address
        3. {{ message }} will be populated by the message the user typed in into the form
  * Set up an Outbound template (like the one below) & save
    ![Screenshot of EmailJS](./public//img/documentation/emailJS-outboundTemplate.png)
      * Note that the items in double curly braces {{ like this }} are varaibles that will be populated autmatically by the web app – the inputs you're expecting for the outbound template are:
        1. {{ cc_List }} will be populated with a CC list
        2. {{ user_email }} will be populated by the user's email address
        2. {{ subject }} will be populated with the quote info
        3. {{ message }} will be populated with the quote
        3. {{ companyName }} will be populated with the company name
        * Note: to change these values in the code itself, you will need to edit 
        ```src/utils/SendEmail.js ```
4. One you have set up **both** inbound & outbound templates, retrieve & save their **Template IDs**
![Screenshot of EmailJS](./public//img/documentation/emailJS-templateIds.png)
5. Navigate to your EmailJS account details & retreive your **Public Key**  

### Adding EmailJS credentials to codebase
1. Create a .env file in the project's root directory
2. Add .env to your .gitignore file & commit to protect your creds from getting published to github
3. Update your .env file with the following:
```
NEXT_PUBLIC_EMAILJS_SERVICE_ID = "YOUR_SERVICE_ID"
NEXT_PUBLIC_EMAILJS_INTRO_TEMPLATE_ID = "YOUR_INBOUND_TEMPLATE_ID"
NEXT_PUBLIC_EMAILJS_QUOTE_TEMPLATE_ID = "YOUR_OUTBOUND_TEMPLATE_ID"
NEXT_PUBLIC_EMAILJS_PUBLIC_KEY = "YOUR_PUBLIC_KEY"
```

Once set up, this should successully send an email from the footer and from the get quote feature in the cart. If you run into errors, make sure your IDs in the .env file are in quotes and that there are no commas or semicolons.

### Setting up Firebase 
Google's Firebase is an app development platform that stores app data in the cloud. Firestore is a noSQL database, where data are stored as **documents** in **collections**, like files in a folder. Firestore is used in this app to store mailing list data and can be expanded to hold inventory, quotes and more.
1. Setup a Firebase account
    * Visit https://firebase.google.com/
    * Click 'Get Started' 
    * Log in or create an accout
2. Create Firebase project
    * Visit the [Firebase console](https://console.firebase.google.com/)
    * Click 'Add project'
    * Follow the prompts to continue & finish setting up project
3. Set up Firestore
    * From the [Firebase console](https://console.firebase.google.com/), click on the project you've just created
    * On the left sidebar, in the Product Categories menu, click the 'Build' dropdown
    * Select 'Firestore Database'
    * From the Cloud Firestore page, click 'Create Database', a setup wizard will launch
    * For a quick setup: 
      * Select 'Start in test mode' 
      * Click the 'Next' button
      * On the next page, leave defaults and click 'Enable' 
      * Wait for Firebase to create your database – when it's complete, you'll be redirected to the Firestore database dashboard
4. Add Firebase to our app
    * From the [Firebase console](https://console.firebase.google.com/), click on the project you've just created a database for
    * Underneath the text that reads, 'Get started by adding Firebase to your app'
      * Click the </> icon to add Firebase to a web app
      * Create app nickname (PROJECT_NAME-web works well)
      * Click 'Register app' 
5. Get Firebase credentials
    * From the [Firebase console](https://console.firebase.google.com/), click on the project you've just created a database for & registered
    * On the left sidebar, next to the home icon and 'Project Overview'
      * Click the gear icon
      * Select 'Project Settings' from the menu
    * From the Project Settings page, scroll down to the area labeled 'Your apps', make sure npm is selected as your SDK, and look for a code block that looks like this:
      ```
      const firebaseConfig = {
      apiKey: "abcdefghiJKLMN-oPQrStuv",
      authDomain: "project-name.firebaseapp.com",
      projectId: "project-name",
      storageBucket: "project-name.appspot.com",
      appId: "1:123456789:web:abc1234567890",
      };
      ```
      Take note! You will need these unique credentials for the next step.
    
### Adding Firebase credentials to codebase
*If you have already set up an .env file to set up EmailJs, skip to step 3*
1. Create a .env file in the project's root directory
2. Add .env to your .gitignore file & commit to protect your creds from getting published to github
3. Update your .env file with the following:
```
NEXT_PUBLIC_apiKey="YOUR_FIREBASE_API_KEY"
NEXT_PUBLIC_authDomain="YOUR_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN"
NEXT_PUBLIC_projectId="YOUR_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID"
NEXT_PUBLIC_storageBucket="YOUR_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET"
NEXT_PUBLIC_messagingSenderId="YOUR_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID"
NEXT_PUBLIC_appId="YOUR_FIREBASE_APP_ID"
```
Now, data entered in the Mailing List sign up form will be stored in Firestore. To extend functionality, visit the [Firebase docs](https://firebase.google.com/docs/guides#jump-into-firebase-on-your-platform).

<!-- ## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details -->
